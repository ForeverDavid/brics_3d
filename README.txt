                BRICS_3D - 3D Perception and Modeling Library
              

What is it?
-----------
 
BRICS_3D is the BRICS library for 3D perception and modeling. It offers perception
algorithms to create a processing chain for object recognition or environment reconstruction 
(e.g. triangle representation) via data from 3D sensors. 
	
Beside the algorithms for perception the BRICS_3D library implements a novel scene graph based
world modeling approach to maintain the processed 3D data over a longer period of time.	 
This library is biased towards 3D perception and modeling for mobile manipulation applications. 


Project website

For the latest documentation pages please go to:

http://www.best-of-robotics.org/brics_3d/


Installation
------------

Please see the file called INSTALL.txt for detailed instructions. As an 
overview you will need to satisfy (at least) the required dependencies: 

   1. Boost 1.37 (or higher)
   2. Eigen2 2.0.13 (or higher, Eigen3 is recommended)

Then compile with:

 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build 
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install


Folder structure
----------------

"src" contains the main source code
"examples" contains the test applications and serves as a development sand box
"lib" contains the compiled libraries
"bin" contains all compiled binaries (which are linked against the libraries)

"doc" contains the html files generated by doxgen (just invoke doxygen BRICS_3D.doxyfile)
"externals" contains the (modified) external libraries and some cmake scripts (to check prerequisites)
"build" for out-of-source build with cmake


How to build your own application
---------------------------------

1.) Create new .cpp with main method in examples folder
2.) Edit CMakeLists.txt in examples folder e.i. add (at least) the following lines
   (of course without < and > ):
ADD_EXECUTABLE(<your_application> <your_application.cpp>) # compile application
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(<your_application> brics3d_core brics3d_algorithm brics3d_util) 


Integration into Eclipse (with CDT)
-----------------------------------

1.) Build in Eclipse GUI (follow instructions in "Compilation" section first)
Open the project's properties -> "C/C++ Build" and _disable_:
* Use default builder command
* Generate makefiles automatically  

Fill "Build command" field with:
make -C ${workspace_loc:}/BRICS_3D/build


2.) Run in Eclipse GUI
Open the "Run Configurations" window and manually add in the "C/C++ Application"
field: bin/<your_application>

Optionally the check box "Connect process input _output to a terminal." can be 
enabled (recommended).


3.) Debug in Eclipse GUI
Follow the previous step and make sure the following line exists in the main 
CMakeLists.txt (located in root folder): SET(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE DEBUG)
or use make VERBOSE=1 -C ${workspace_loc:}/BRICS_3D/build as build command.


4.) Additional Plug-ins
The following Eclipse plug-ins might be of interest for you:
* ECLOX - for doxygen documentation generation (http://download.gna.org/eclox/update/)
* cmake editor - to have a nicer visual appearance of CMake files (but still requires 
  manual editing)(http://cmakeed.sourceforge.net/updates)


Documentation
-------------

This software is documented with doxygen. To generate html files use:

 $ doxygen BRICS_3D.doxyfile

The result can be found in the subfolder: doc/html
