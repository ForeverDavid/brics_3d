@page examples Examples

This page summarizes examples on how to use the BRICS_3D library. The following examples are available:

- @ref examples
 - @ref demo_example
 - @ref pointcloud_viewer
 - @ref world_model_example

@section demo_example Demo application
The BRIC_3D_Demo program demonstrates some core capabilities of the BRICS_3D library.
It will start by loading either a depth image or a point cloud,
down-sample the data in an Octree-based filtering step,
optionally register two point clouds into common coordinate system,
creates triangle mesh and visualize the result.

The programs sources are listed below. Find further explanation inline in the code.

@include BRICS_3D_Demo.cpp


@section pointcloud_viewer Simple point cloud viewer

Simple point cloud viewer program loads a point cloud from a txt file, optionally filters the data with an Octree based
sub-sampling filter to reduce the data and finally visualizes the result.

The programs sources are listed below. Find further explanation inline in the code.

@include pointcloud_viewer.cpp


@section world_model_example World model sample application

This world model example shows how to initialize a world model, add a SceneObject, formulate a Query to find this SceneObject 
and browse the result. 

The programs sources are listed below. Find further explanation inline in the code.

@dontinclude WorldModelTest.cpp 
@skip testSimpleHanoiUseCase
@until testTowerOfHanoi
